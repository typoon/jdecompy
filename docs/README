What is it?
===========

jdecompy is a .class decompiler. It gives the user a Python class representing
the .class file and a set of functions that can be used to manipulate and
inspect such .class file.

For now, the available features are:
*   Rename the class file
*   Add new methods to the class file (user needs to supply the bytecode
manually)


Decompiling a .class
====================

In this first example, I'll demonstrate how to decompile a class file, and what
is the available information that can be accessed.

from classfile import ClassFile
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Use: python3 main.py File.class")
        sys.exit(1)

    c = ClassFile(sys.argv[1])
    c.load()


That's it! The variable "c" is now an instance of the ClassFile class
representing a **.class** file.

Accessing the constant pool

The constant_pool is bla bla bla
